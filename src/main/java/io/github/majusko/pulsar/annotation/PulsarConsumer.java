     * instances or consumers of the same subscription name. With a default configuration you don't need to worry about horizontal
     * scaling because message will be delivered to each pod in a cluster since in case of exclusive subscription
     * the name is unique per instance and can be nicely used to update state of each pod in case your service
     * is stateful (For example - you need to update in-memory cached configuration for each instance of authorization microservice).

     * This can be handy in case you are using `Shared` subscription in your application all the time and you
     * don't want to override this value every time you use `@PulsarConsumer`.
